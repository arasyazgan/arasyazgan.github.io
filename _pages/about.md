I am a computer engineer and an [amateur illustrator](https://www.artstation.com/sketching101) based in Seattle. I worked as a VR developer for the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and as a C++ developer at Microsoft's authentication library in Seattle. I am interested in working in game development in order to participate in making original, elegant, and creatively satisfying video games that many people can enjoy as works of art.
