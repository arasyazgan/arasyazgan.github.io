I am a computer engineer and an [amateur illustrator](https://www.artstation.com/sketching101) based in Seattle. I worked as a VR developer for the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and as a C++ developer at Microsoft's authentication library in Seattle. I am interested in working in game development in order to participate in making original, elegant, and creatively satisfying video games that many people can enjoy as works of art.

In the last two years, I've started running tabletop RPGs for my friends. Having a creative written and performative outlet revitalized me. I crafted detailed worlds, worked with my characters to help them come up with their characters' backstories in a way that would integrate with the world, and wrote plot hooks that were appealing to my players and their characters. I drew and painted my world and my NPCs. I wrote homebrew creatures with interesting and engaging mechanics for my players to fight or encounter. The joy I felt as my players made their ways through the world with curiosity and excitement reminded me why I wanted to become an engineer in the first place: to create stories and games that people can enjoy and think about long after they're done playing, which I myself have experienced countless times playing my favorite games myself..
