You can find the [game and its demo here](https://unicornly.itch.io/sunfall).

Sunfall is a puzzle game that uses the environment and the puzzles themselves to tell a story about a delapidated world that has suffered a cataclysm many years ago. The player travels back and forth in time to the day the Sunfall event happened and to the modern day when they try to repair the sun. I did the following:
 <ul>
  <li>Design the core gameplay of traversing from the night-time ruined world to the inhabited day-time world and back in order to solve puzzles</li>
  <li>Design a number of the puzzles in the demo</li>
  <li>Draw and design all of the portraits, sprites, and animations for characters</li>
  <li>Draw and design all background elements and maps</li>
</ul>
