## About the project

This project is part of an effort in the Electrical Engineering department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to make certain concepts easier to visualize for the Fields and Waves I course. 

## My Contributions
 <ul>
  <li>Created simulations for the physics of electromagnetic waves in given custom parameters for mediums they propagate through</li>
  <li>Developed code for tutorials and laboratories for wave propagation in virtual reality for the students to be able to learn</li>
  <li>Developed and integrated UI for the labs I developed</li>
  <li>Worked with colleagues to integrate shared code I created into other labs they were working on</li>
  <li>Debugged code belonging to various team members</li>
</ul>
