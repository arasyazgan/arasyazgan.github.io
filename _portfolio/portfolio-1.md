## About the project
This project is part of an effort in the Electrical Engineering department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to make certain concepts easier to visualize for the Fields and Waves I course. 

## My Contributions
 <ul>
  <li>Created simulations for the physics of electromagnetic waves in given custom parameters for mediums they propagate through</li>
  <li>Developed code for tutorials and laboratories for wave propagation in virtual reality for the students to be able to learn</li>
  <li>Developed and integrated UI for the labs I developed</li>
  <li>Worked with colleagues to integrate shared code I created into other labs they were working on</li>
  <li>Debugged code belonging to various team members</li>
</ul> 

## Intentions & Process
The goal behind this project was to make concepts difficult to understand and visualize, such as electromagnetic waves. The way I originally intended to achieve this goal was to make a simulator for transverse electromagnetic waves where the students could input different parameters for the medium and the wave, and see how the waves would end up looking. After allowing some students to test it out, our team asked for feedback. While the players enjoyed the lab quite a bit, I realized a lot of the mechanics of the lab were difficult to grasp, as I had to help students navigate the lab consistently. As a result of this feedback, I programmed a tutorial system that could be plugged into any of the other labs and implemented it for my lab. I added a model of the controller with indicators of what each button does. The tutorial helped students have a more guided experience to understand how the lab works so that once they finished the tutorial, when they had free reign of the lab, they had a much better understanding of everything they could do.

Additionally, to spruce up the environment in which the players were doing the lab, I found a model of the ISS on the Unity Asset Store, and used one of its rooms. This room had some laptops and tablets with screens I could use to place the calculator and tutorials. Along with the change in environment from an empty room to an ISS workstation, this change from floating ephemeral menus to tangible screens greatly increased the immersions the students had.
