Demo:
This is a VR game I created with a couple of friends. It is a game where the player controls a spaceship that can also transform into a mech (akin to a Gundam) powered with rocket launched fists, swords that slice ships and asteroids in two, and guns. The gameplay focuses on flight and space combat against other spaceships.
