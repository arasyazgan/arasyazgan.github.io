## About the project
This is a top down shoot-em-up game I created with a couple of friends. The player controls a woman in a prison facility on the moon who is trying to escape. They collect weapons and make their way out of the facility, either avoiding or fighting prison guards patrolling the area.

## Intentions & Process
This was the first project I finished on where I made a game design document. I teamed up with three others (two of whom worked with me on [VR Spaceship Dogfighting Simulator](https://arasyazgan.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)) to bring this to life. Our original design had a much larger scope than what we had time and resources for. We had originally intended to tell a story, including a dialogue system where NPCs would talk amongst themselves with text bubbles hanging overhead.
